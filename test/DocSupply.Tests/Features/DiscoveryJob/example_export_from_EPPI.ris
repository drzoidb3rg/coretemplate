N2  - To date, millions of people have been treated with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (TmAbs) for various indications. It is becoming increasingly clear that TmAbs can be immunogenic, which may reduce efficacy or induce adverse effects. Over the years, the importance of antibody formation has been questioned and sometimes minimized, as few antibody responses to TmAbs (HACA or HAHA) were reported. However, the methods to detect and quantify such antibodies used in the past have been problematic. Only recently, methods have been developed that have adequate sensitivity and are not seriously disturbed by false-positive reactions caused by rheumatoid factors, natural antibodies to Fab or F(ab')&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fragments, or Fc interactions of IgG4. The large number of treated patients, in combination with these new assays, presents a unique opportunity to study the anti-antibody immune response in man, possibly allowing us to manipulate immunogenicity in the future.

N2  - The armamentarium of medications for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is growing and becoming more complicated to use. Immunomodulators are a class of medications that have found a niche for the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Because of the mounting supporting evidence for efficacy, the most commonly-used immunomodulators are azathioprine, mercaptopurine, methotrexate and ciclosporin. These medications are being used more often due to their steroid-sparing and potentially surgery-sparing effects. Immunomodulators are also known for a significant side-effect profile and require careful monitoring. This review provides the latest information for clinicians on efficacy, side-effects, dosing and monitoring of these medications for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

N2  - Infliximab is effective for treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and is recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to medical therapy or who are intolerant of or do not desire to take the potential risk of using specific agents including immunomodulators (cyclosporine A, azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine), corticosteroids, and, potentially, mesalamine. Future trials are needed to assess the efficacy of infliximab with immunomodulators to see if additional benefit is achieved so that the risk-benefit ratio is positive. Based on the favorable efficacy of infliximab for UC therapy, the ground work has been established for evaluating infliximab and addressing some of the many unanswered questions and also for assessing other anti-TNF agents and streamlining the anti-TNG antibody to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and ease administration.

N2  - BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to determine the incidence of active tuberculosis in an inflammatory bowel disease population compared with the general population before the availability of infliximabMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study with the General Practice Research Database from January 1988-October 1997. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease subjects with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up were matched to randomly selected subjects from the remaining population on year of birth (+/-5 years), sex, and primary care practice at ratio of 1:4. Active tuberculosis was determined by tuberculosis diagnostic codes. The incidence of active tuberculosis in the inflammatory bowel disease population and the relative risk for active tuberculosis in inflammatory bowel disease population compared with the general population were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for confoundersRESULTS: There were 16,213 inflammatory bowel disease subjects and 66,512 control subjects. The annual incidence of active tuberculosis was 20/100,000 in inflammatory bowel disease subjects compared with 9/100,000 in control subjects, yielding an unadjusted relative risk for active tuberculosis of 2.36 (95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.74). Adjusting for confounders, corticosteroid use and smoking, the odds ratio of inflammatory bowel disease for active tuberculosis was 1.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-5.20)CONCLUSIONS: During the pre-infliximab era, inflammatory bowel disease subjects appeared to be at higher risk for active tuberculosis than the general population, with immunosuppressant medications likely the main reason for this increased risk

N2  - Although the clear cause of Crohn's disease is not known, the etiology of Crohn's dis-ease is believed to involve the interplay of the intestinal microbial environment, genetic predisposition, and dysregulation of the immune system. The basis of treating Crohn's disease with antibiotics stems from research revealing commensal intestinal bacteria playing a role in activation of the intestinal immune system. Antibiotics have a limited but vital role in the treatment of Crohn's disease. Broad spectrum antibiotics such as metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and rifaximin have been evaluated in clinical trials for active Crohn's disease. There has also been suspicion of species as a possible cause for Crohn's disease, and anti-mycobacterial therapy has also been evaluated in clinical tri-als for treating active Crohn's disease. Specific indications for antibiotics in Crohn's disease, as well as dose and duration of antibiotic therapy in Crohn's disease are described in this review

N2  - Mucormycosis is a rare and often fatal invasive fungal infection mostly seen in immune-compromised individuals. A high index of clinical suspicion is necessary, so that effective preemptive therapy can be started, as timely intervention is crucial. In this series we present three cases of invasive mucormycosis in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease that had received therapy with immunomodulators prior to the infection. All three had varied clinical manifestations. We also review the literature of invasive mucormycosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Â© 2014 Maheen Z. Abidi et al

N2  - The clinical need for better treatments as well as the significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of inflammation on one hand, and the progressive development of biotechnology on the other, were the driving force for the emergence of new treatments for autoimmune disorders at the beginning of the 21st century, heralding the 'age of biologic response modifying agents or biologics. This new class of drugs, although in use for just over a decade, has revolutionized the treatment of many inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatic, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. They have already made an immense impact on the quality of life of patients experiencing many years of combined immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory treatments for chronic and often debilitating diseases. As these drugs were developed with the aim of altering specific components in the immune system function and, in particular, the inflammatory response, it is not surprising that infectious complications, including the severe and unusual, are among the serious side effects alongside other features of dysregulated immune system function, such as autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation and malignancy. The aim of this article is to highlight and anticipate further the infectious risks of the most commonly used biologics in children. 2010 Future Medicine Ltd

N2  - Background/purpose: The aim of this study is to analyze the efficacy and tolerance of tocilizumab in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA). Methods: We retrospectively studied patients with TA (ACR and/or Ishikawa's criteria): 5 French multicenter cases and 39 from the literature. Clinical, biological, radiological disease activity and treatment were analyzed before tocilizumab, during the follow-up and at the last available visit. Results: Forty-four patients (median age 26. years [3-65];) were included in the present study: 5 patients from the 3 French university hospitals and 39 cases from the literature review. Median follow-up after initiation of tocilizumab was 15. months [8-33]. Clinical and biological activities significantly decreased within 3. months, similarly to steroid amount (from 15. mg/day [5-75] at baseline to 10. mg/day [2-30] at 6. months; p &lt; 0.05) and steroid-dependence rate. Even radiological activity did not significantly decrease at 6. months, significant decrease of arterial FDG uptake was noted at 6. months. Median duration of tocilizumab treatment was 9. months [3-180]. At the last visit, tocilizumab was continued in 17/32 patients (53%), and was discontinued in the 15 remaining cases because of the remission (n = 5), relapse (n = 3), persistent radiological activity (n = 3), cutaneous rash (n = 2), severe infection (n = 1) and lacking of care welfare system (n = 1). No death related to tocilizumab treatment was noted. Conclusion: This study show the efficacy of tocilizumab in terms of clinical, biological and radiological response, as well as steroid-sparing agent. Only well-designed studies could definitely address the efficacy of tocilizumab in TA. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V

N2  - Background &amp; Aims: Osteoporosis is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Corticosteroids induce a rapid and important bone loss. Clinical trials have shown oral bisphosphonates to effectively prevent steroid-induced bone loss. However, patients with IBD have been excluded from most of these studies because of potential digestive adverse events. Clodronate is a non-amino-bisphosphonate available in intravenous form without expected digestive (as oral bisphosphonates) or proinflammatory (as amine bisphosphonates) side effects. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of intravenous clodronate in preventing steroid-induced bone loss. Methods: A 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in IBD patients beginning a steroid therapy. Sixty-seven patients (median disease duration, 38 mo; range, 1-240 mo) were randomized to receive one infusion per 3 months of either intravenous clodronate (900 mg, n = 33) or placebo. All the patients received calcium (1 g/day) and vitamin D (800 IU/day). The main outcome was the change in lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) between baseline and 1 year. Secondary outcomes included change in femoral neck BMD and adverse events. Results: After 1 year, there was no change in BMD in the clodronate group, neither at the spine (-0.2%, not significant) nor at the femoral neck (2.3%, NS). In contrast, there was a significant decrease in lumbar spine (-2.0%, P = .0018) and femoral neck (-1.7%, P = .045) BMD in the placebo group. Tolerance to treatment was good. Conclusions: Intravenous clodronate is effective in the prevention of bone loss induced by steroids in patients with IBD. Â© 2007 AGA Institute

N2  - BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are widely used by patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Few data have been published on the impact of CAM on the quality of life (QOL). AIMS: The aim of the study was to describe CAM use in French patients with IBD, identify characteristics associated with CAM use, and assess the impact of CAM on the QOL. METHODS: We conducted an internet survey on CAM through the French IBD patient's association website. Patients had to answer a questionnaire (LimeSurvey application) about sociodemography, IBD treatment, CAM type, socioeconomic data, and QOL using the Short IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ). Patients noted the impact of CAM on their symptoms and on their QOL on a scale of 0-100. CAM users and nonusers were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 936 IBD patients responded and 767 (82.4%) filled up the whole questionnaire: 503 reported CAM use and 172 had never used. The types of CAM reported were diet-based (30.7%), body-based (25.1%), homeopathic or traditional medicine (19.6%), naturopathy (15.2%), and mind-body medicine (9.1%). The gastroenterologist was aware of CAM use in only 46% of patients. CAM users were more likely to have ulcerative colitis [odds ratio (OR)=1.78, P=0.018], clinical remission (OR=1.42, P=0.06), high level of education (OR=1.51, P=0.02), poor observance (OR=1.81, P=0.017), or to have terminated conventional treatment (OR=2.03, P=0.003). CAM users tend to have higher rates of SIBDQ scores, greater than 50 (OR=1.57, P=0.06). Improvement in symptoms and QOL was reported with all CAM types except mind medicine. CONCLUSION: CAM use is widespread among IBD patients. CAM users report improvement in symptoms and QOL, but they tend to stop their conventional treatment. Better information about CAM might improve adherence to conventional treatment. Â© 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins

N2  - Patients who respond to infliximab enjoy many benefits, including improvement in clinical symptoms, less disability, and a better quality of life. Unfortunately, many patients are unresponsive to infliximab therapy. They may be completely refractory to infliximab therapy (ie, primary nonresponders), they may have shown an initial response to therapy that subsequently diminished, or they may be hypersensitive to the drug. For these patients, second-generation tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors will soon be available; adalimumab and certolizumab pegol are the two agents most likely to gain Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of Crohn's disease. This article looks at recent studies using these newer TNF inhibitors in patients in whom infliximab treatment has failed as well as in those who have never received infliximab.

N2  - The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is not completely understood, thus current therapies have been empirical and directed at treating symptoms rather than addressing the cause. In IBD, the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, leads to a persistent intestinal inflammatory response that damages the intestinal mucosa. Recent advances in pharmacologic therapies that target specific cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules have proved successful in alleviating symptoms for some patients. There are 2 selective adsorption apheresis devices that remove leukocytes from whole blood, which are currently available in Japan and Europe-the Cellsorba leukocytapheresis column and the Adacolumn adsorptive extracorporeal granulocyte/monocyte apheresis device. The purported mechanisms of action of these devices have been extensively reviewed and are believed to exert an immunomodulatory and/or anti-inflammatory effect on patients with systemic inflammatory disease. The clinical trials presented here indicate that selective leukocyte apheresis effectively removes activated granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages from peripheral blood while maintaining an excellent safety profile. Despite these findings, large controlled trials of selective leukocyte apheresis in the treatment of IBD are needed to determine the true efficacy of this approach.

N2  - Background: Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is effective in immune-mediated disorders. A prospective, uncontrolled pilot study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ECP in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD) who were refractory to or intolerant of immunosuppressants and/or anti-TNF therapies. Methods: Patients with moderate-to-severely active CD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] 220-450 points) underwent 12 weeks of ECP treatment (Weeks 1-4: twice weekly, every week; Weeks 5-12: twice weekly, every other week). Clinical response was defined as a decrease in the CDAI of &gt;100 points or remission (CDAI &lt;150 points) at Week 12. Patients who responded at Week 12 could receive an additional 12 weeks of ECP treatment (twice weekly, every other week) in an extension study. Results: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled with a mean baseline CDAI score of 314 (range 207-457). At Week 12, 14 patients (50%) responded; 13 patients responded within 6 weeks. Seven patients (25%) attained remission by Week 12. Three of 5 patients with open fistulae at baseline had fistula closure. Response was similar among patients naive to anti-TNF agents and patients who had previously been refractory or intolerant to anti-TNF agents. Of the 12 patients who entered the extension study, 9 (75%) maintained their response at Week 24. Conclusions: In patients with moderate-to-severely active CD who were refractory to or intolerant of immunosuppressants and/or anti-TNF agents, ECP was well tolerated and induced clinical response (50%) and remission (25%) in patients. Most patients were able to maintain a response with continued treatments. Copyright Â© 2009 Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America, Inc

N2  - BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is effective in immune-mediated disorders. A prospective, uncontrolled pilot study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ECP in patients with active Crohn's disease (CD) who were refractory to or intolerant of immunosuppressants and/or anti-TNF therapiesMETHODS: Patients with moderate-to-severely active CD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] 220-450 points) underwent 12 weeks of ECP treatment (Weeks 1-4: twice weekly, every week; Weeks 5-12: twice weekly, every other week). Clinical response was defined as a decrease in the CDAI of &gt;or=100 points or remission (CDAI &lt;150 points) at Week 12. Patients who responded at Week 12 could receive an additional 12 weeks of ECP treatment (twice weekly, every other week) in an extension studyRESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled with a mean baseline CDAI score of 314 (range 207-457). At Week 12, 14 patients (50%) responded; 13 patients responded within 6 weeks. Seven patients (25%) attained remission by Week 12. Three of 5 patients with open fistulae at baseline had fistula closure. Response was similar among patients naive to anti-TNF agents and patients who had previously been refractory or intolerant to anti-TNF agents. Of the 12 patients who entered the extension study, 9 (75%) maintained their response at Week 24CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate-to-severely active CD who were refractory to or intolerant of immunosuppressants and/or anti-TNF agents, ECP was well tolerated and induced clinical response (50%) and remission (25%) in patients. Most patients were able to maintain a response with continued treatments

N2  - Background and aims: An increased incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in patients under anti-TNF-alpha therapy has been reported, but outcome compared with TB in the general population are unknown. Methods: Patients who had active tuberculosis while taking anti-TNF-alpha drugs were studied and compared with a control group of community-acquired TB matched for sex, age and data of TB. Results: Twenty-five cases of TB were reported from a cohort of 765 patients under anti-TNF-alpha from 2001 to 2012. The incidence of TB per 100,000. patient-years was estimated to be 1337, 792 and 405 respectively for those on infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept. Twelve patients had inflammatory bowel disease, ten had rheumatologic diseases and three had psoriasis. From the 17 patients screened for latent TB before anti-TNF-alpha, three were treated with isoniazid. TB was diagnosed 1-108. months after starting anti-TNF-alpha, being the median time six, seven and 89. months respectively for those on infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept. Sixty per cent of the cases had extra-pulmonary TB. No deaths occurred in the case groups, while two died in control TB patients. Patients on anti-TNF-alpha drugs had more frequent extra-pulmonary TB, fever on presentation, higher mean C-reactive protein and lower positive rate of acid-fast bacilli. Conclusions: TB may still occur in those with negative testing, some of them probably representing new infections instead of reactivations. Three out of 25 patients had TB in spite of previously treated LTB, although, the outcome of TB was not worse than in the general population. 2013 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation

N2  - Listeria monocytogenes is an aerobic gram positive intracellular bacillus, predominantly affecting pregnant women, immunocompromised patients and old individuals. Invasive listeriosis, meningitis and meningoencephalitis, bacteraemia with or without joint, eye or heart focalization are clinical manifestations of the disease. Anti-TNF-alpha drugs blocking the host's response against various microorganisms, particularly intracellular agents like Listeria monocytogenes, increase the risk of disease. We report two cases of L. monocytogenes meningitis in ulcerative colitis patients under infliximab plus steroids. One patient is HIV-1 infected. A review of reported invasive listeriosis cases under anti-TNF drugs is also showed. Â© 2012 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation

N2  - Human nocardiosis, caused by Nocardia spp., an ubiquitous soil-borne bacteria, is a rare granulomatous disease close related to immune dysfunctions. Clinically can occur as an acute life-threatening disease, with lung, brain and skin being commonly affected. The infection was classically diagnosed in HIV infected persons, organ transplanted recipients and long term corticosteroid treated patients. Currently the widespread use of immunomodulators and immunossupressors in the treatment of inflammatory diseases changed this scenario. Our purpose is to review all published cases of nocardiosis in immunomodulated patients due to inflammatory diseases and describe clinical and laboratory findings. We reviewed the literature concerning human cases of nocardiosis published between 1980 and 2014 in peer reviewed journals. Eleven cases of nocardiosis associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) prescription (9 related with infliximab and 2 with adalimumab) were identified; 7 patients had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 4 had rheumatological conditions; nocardia infection presented as cutaneous involvement in 3 patients, lung disease in 4 patients, hepatic in one and disseminated disease in 3 patients. From the 10 cases described in IBD patients 7 were associated with anti-TNF and 3 with steroids and azathioprine. In conclusion, nocardiosis requires high levels of clinical suspicion and experience of laboratory staff, in order to establish a timely diagnosis and by doing so avoid worst outcomes. Treatment for long periods tailored by the susceptibility of the isolated species whenever possible is essential. The safety of restarting immunomodulators or anti-TNF after the disease or the value of prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole is still debated

N2  - Background: Crohn's colitis refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy is commonly seen in tertiary care centers for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We report our experience in managing pediatric refractory Crohn's colitis with concomitant use of methotrexate and anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Methods: We reviewed records from 2007 to 2010 at the Mayo Clinic pediatric IBD center. We included all patients with Crohn's disease (CD) failing anti-TNF-alpha therapy who then received concomitant methotrexate. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as inactive disease in accordance with the short pediatric CD activity index (PCDAI). The secondary endpoint was last day of follow-up. Results: Fourteen patients with CD received concomitant methotrexate and anti-TNF-alpha treatment (age, mean [range], 15.7 [6-20] years; standard deviation [SD], 3.4 years). Mean age at diagnosis was 12.5 years (range, 3-17 years; SD, 3.83 years). The male-to-female ratio was 10:4. All patients had moderate to severe disease activity using the short PCDAI and had predominately Crohn's colitis. Twelve patients were previously treated with thiopurines (85.7%). Seven patients (50%) were in clinical remission within an average of 6 weeks postmethotrexate induction. Five patients (35.7%) experienced adverse events including nausea and headache, yet only one discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Infection with Clostridium difficile was common, complicating therapy in four patients (28.6%). Conclusions: Concomitant use of methotrexate and anti-TNF-alpha therapy is a promising option for children with refractory Crohn's colitis.

N2  - Purpose of review The use of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents to treat Crohn's disease in children has become quite common over the past decade. There are incomplete data to guide the clinician in choosing whether adjunctive therapy should be added to optimize response to these drugs. Recent findings Addition of immunomodulators such as thiopurines or possibly methotrexate can increase anti-TNF drug levels, reduce the risk of antidrug antibodies, and improve response. This is tempered by the reports of younger patients developing hepato-splenic T-cell lymphoma while taking thiopurines with and without concomitant anti-TNF medications. The available data are reviewed including recent pediatric reports. Summary The addition of immunomodulators to anti-TNF therapies can optimize their performance. Careful discussion of the risks and side-effects must be undertaken when considering this approach. Additional knowledge is required to stratify which children with inflammatory bowel disease need this approach, and/or who are at risk for significant complications.

N2  - Development of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNFalpha) treatment offers the potential to alter radically the course of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease using modalities directed against a specific inflammatory mediator. Controlled randomised trials in these diseases demonstrate clinical benefit associated with significant improvement in patients with severe active joint and intestinal disease, often when conventional therapies are unsuccessful. To date, anti-TNFalpha therapy has been well tolerated and shows a favourable safety profile. This review considers the nature of this therapy and current evidence of its clinical benefit and adverse effects

N2  - TNF-alpha is a crucial Pro-inflammatory and immunregulatory cytokine that is central to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. A number of controlled trials have shown effectiveness for TNF-alpha inhibitiors in several diseases, in particular rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease. These agents may also be useful in additional autoimmune conditions. The introduction of TNF-a inhibitors has revolutionized the therapeutic approach and treatment paradigms especially for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Despite extensive investigation, the full profile of their mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. Optimal use of these agents requires consideration of their possible adverse effects. in addition to the presently available TNF-alpha blockers, other agents targeting this key mediator are under study. Recent advances and future directions in anti-TNF-alpha therapy are discussed in this paper. 2007 Informa UK Ltd

N2  - Background. Success achieved in two subtypes of Crohn s disease has persuaded a few investigators to experiment the monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor antibody infliximab in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. So far, however the results (achieved in some 30 steroid-refractory patients included in two independent full-papers) indicate a rate of initial response of 50% and of remission of 25%. Aims. To analyse data of an open trial conducted on consecutive steroid-refractory severely ill patients admitted to our referral Unit. Patients and Methods. In 9 months, infliximab was given to 8 patients (4 male, 4 female aged 20-60 years) with uncontrolled ulcerative colitis of whom 6 were non-responders to parenteral steroids. All received the first infliximab dose as an intravenous infusion of 5 mg/kg. Results. Of the 8, 4 (50%) did not respond to the first injection and were submitted to urgent colectomy; the other four responded clinically. Two have maintained clinical remission for 7 months, without the need for steroids; both have received daily azathioprine at 2 mg/kg, and only one has received two further infliximab injections. Of the other two, one received a second injection at week 5, despite this relapsed, and underwent elective colectomy at that time; the other relapsed at 6 months and showed a partial response to a repeat infliximab infusion. Thus, the rate of sustained response is 2/8 (25%) in this study. Conclusion. These results, achieved in an open uncontrolled fashion, seem to reflect those of other independent studies. In our opinion, these findings warrant an in-depth reappraisal of the indication to use infliximab as rescue treatment for refractory ulcerative colitis

N2  - Aim. This was a retrospective survey of 88 inflammatory bowel disease patients (43 with ulcerative colitis, 38 with Crohn's disease, 7 with indeterminate colitis) who were visited between January 2008 and June 2009 at a newly established out-patient service at a primary care hospital in Turin. Methods. Treatments included corticosteroids (48 courses), mesalamines (79 courses), thiopurines (46 courses), and biological drugs (three treatments). With more extra-intestinal manifestations, more steroid needs, more visits and more surgeries, Crohn's proved more fastidious than ulcerative colitis. All of the drugs used gave side-effects that required skilful action for control: switch to mercaptopurine was advantageously used to react to azathioprine intolerance. Results. Percentages of steroid needs, of stable remission, and resort to surgery were 30, 50, &lt;20 and 40, 27, 30, respectively in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's. Thiopurines played a crucial role in the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis: the patients maintaining remission in the absence of azathioprine had either been resected or had left-sided disease only; left-sided disease proved also fairly responsive to beclomethasone. The unusual conduction of this service by a single doctor caused an increased trust-in-physician, but also more bias and placebo effects as drawbacks. Conclusion. The results suggest that in the last 30 years management of inflammatory bowel disease has still improved mainly due to refinement of the use of traditional drugs

N2  - Dysregulated inflammation in the gut, designated clinically as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is manifested by the prototypic phenotypes of an Arthus-like reaction restricted to the mucosa of the colon, as in ulcerative colitis, or a transmural granulomatous reaction, as in Crohns disease, or an indeterminate form of the two polar types. That the inflammation of IBD can trespass the boundaries of the bowel has long been known, with articular, ophthalmologic, cutaneous, hepatobiliary or other complications/associations - some autoimmune and others not - affecting significant numbers of patients with IBD. Also notable is the frequency of diagnosis of IBD-type diseases on a background of systemic, (mostly myelo-hematological) disorders, associated with alterations of either (or both) innate or adaptive arms of the immune response. Finally, cases of IBD are reported to occur as an adverse effect of TNF inhibitors. Bone marrow transplant has been proven to be the only curative measure for some of the above cases. Thus, in effect, the IBDs should now be regarded as a systemic, rather than bowel-localized, disease. Genome-wide association studies have been informative in consolidating the view of three phenotypes of IBD (ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease and mixed) and, notably, are revealing that the onset of IBD can be linked to polymorphisms in regulatory miRNAs, or to nucleotide sequences coding for regulatory lymphokines and/or their receptors. At the effector level, we emphasize the major role of the Th17/IL-23 axis in dictating the perpetuation of intestinal inflammation, augmented by a failure of physiological control by regulatory T-cells. In conclusion, there is a central genesis of the defects underlying IBD, which therefore, in our opinion, is best accommodated by the concept of IBD as more of a syndrome than an autonomous disease. This altered mindset should upgrade our knowledge of IBD, influence its medical care and provide a platform for further advances. 2011 Expert Reviews Ltd

N2  - Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. The etiology is unknown. Risk factors include a history of recent infection with Salmonella or Campylobacter, living in Western industrialized nations and at higher latitudes, and a family history of the disease. The incidence peaks in early adulthood, but patients can develop the disorder from early childhood through adulthood. Ulcerative colitis often presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia. It is important to exclude infectious etiologies. Anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level may suggest inflammatory bowel disease, but the absence of laboratory abnormalities does not rule out ulcerative colitis. The diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed through endoscopic biopsy. First-line treatment is therapy with 5-aminosalicylic acid. Corticosteroids may be added if 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy is ineffective. Infliximab can be added to induce and sustain remission. Patients with severe or nonresponsive ulcerative colitis should be hospitalized, and intravenous corticosteroids should be given. If medical management has been ineffective, surgical intervention is indicated for severe disease. Patients with ulcerative colitis have an increased risk of colon cancer and should have periodic colonoscopy beginning eight to 10 years after diagnosis. Â© 2013 American Academy of Family Physicians

N2  - Objectives: Infliximab(IFX) was recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) in pediatric patients &gt;6yrs who had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Pharmacokinetic(PK) and exposure-response(ER) relationship data from a study evaluating IFX in pediatric UC(C0168T72) are presented. Comparisons with the PK of IFX in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) and adult UC patients are described. Methods: This was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study which assessed the safety and efficacy of IFX treatment in pediatric patients aged 6-17yrs who had moderately to severely active UC. 60 patients with UC(Mayo score 6-12, including endoscopic subscore &gt;2) who failed to respond to or tolerate treatment with 6-MP, AZA, corticosteroids, and/or 5-ASA were enrolled. Patients received IFX 5mg/kg at wks 0, 2, &amp; 6; those who achieved clinical response at wk8 were randomized to IFX 5mg/kg q8wks through wk46 or q12wks through wk42. Patients who lost response during maintenance were eligible to increase the IFX dose and/or frequency one time. All patients who received &gt;1 dose of IFX and had &gt;1 measurable IFX concentration were included in PK analysis. Serum IFX concentrations (SIC) were determined from blood samples collected at various timepoints. Results: Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were as follows: 53% were female, median values for age 14.5yrs, weight 50.8kg, disease duration 1.4yrs, CRP 0.3mg/dL, Mayo score 8.0, and pediatric UC activity index(PUCAI) score 55; 62% and 53% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and immunomodulators at baseline, respectively. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally comparable across groups. At wk8, higher SIC were associated with higher proportions of patients achieving efficacy endpoints (illustrated in Figure 1). IFX PK was not influenced by age (6-11 vs 12-17yrs) or baseline use of concomitant immunomodulators. During maintenance, patients who remained on 5mg/kg q8wks achieved higher steady-state trough SIC vs those on 5mg/kg q12wks (median: 1.9mug/mL vs 0.8mug/mL. In patients who stepped up from 5mg/kg q8wks to 10mg/kg q8wks, the median pre-infusion SIC was 2.9mug/mL 16wks after step-up vs 1.1mug/mL before step-up. The elimination half-life of IFX and peak SIC in pediatric UC patients were generally consistent with those observed in pediatric CD patients and adult UC patients (data not shown); however, the median steady-state trough SIC in pediatric patients with UC appeared to be lower than those in adults with UC. Conclusions: The PK and ER relationship of IFX in pediatric UC patients administered 5mg/kg at wks 0, 2 and 6 followed by maintenance doses of 5mg/kg given q8wks support this dosing regimen in UC patients aged 6-17yrs. Further evaluation of PK in children &lt;6 yrs may be needed. (Figure Presented)

N2  - Background: To assess infliximab pharmacokinetics in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: This phase 3, randomized, open-label multicenter study enrolled 60 children (6-17 yr) with moderate-to-severely active UC (Mayo score, 6-12; endoscopic subscore, &gt;2), despite conventional therapy. Patients received infliximab 5-mg/kg induction infusions at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Week 8 clinical responders (n = 45) were randomized to infliximab 5 mg/kg given every 8 weeks (q8w) through week 46 or every 12 weeks (q12w) through week 42. Patients losing response during maintenance infliximab were eligible to increase the dose (5-&gt;10 mg/kg) and/or shorten the dosing interval (q12w-&gt;q8w). Blood samples were collected for infliximab concentration and pharmacokinetic determinations. Results: Infliximab pharmacokinetics were not influenced by age (6-11 yr versus 12-17 yr), baseline immunomodulator use, or the extent of UC. At week 8, higher serum infliximab concentrations (&gt;41.1 mg/mL) were associated with greater proportions of patients achieving efficacy endpoints (clinical response, 92.9%; mucosal healing, 92.9%; and clinical remission, 64.3%) versus those with lower serum concentrations (&lt;18.1 mug/mL; 53.9%, 53.9%, and 30.8%, respectively). At week 30, higher median trough serum infliximab concentrations were observed with infliximab 5 mg/kg q8w (1.9 mg/mL) versus q12w (0.8 mug/mL) and with infliximab 10 mg/kg (2.9 mug/mL) versus 5 mg/kg (1.1 mug/mL) among patients who are regimen adjusted. Conclusions: Infliximab pharmacokinetics/exposure-response relationship in patients with UC aged 6 to 17 years were generally comparable with those observed in reference adult UC populations, supporting using infliximab 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 followed by maintenance dosing with 5 mg/kg q8w in these patients. A positive relationship was noted between serum infliximab level and clinical effect following induction therapy similar to adults. Copyright 2013 Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America, Inc

N2  - Recent advances in biological therapies have proved highly effective in treating psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions, including psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and ankylosing spondylitis. However, adverse effects related to their immunosuppression have been observed, including an increased propensity to viral infections. This review evaluates the evidence of herpes zoster (HZ) risk from biologics based on clinical reports, cohort studies and randomized controlled studies. The risk of HZ associated with these agents remains controversial, especially when comparing their risk with non-biological therapy used to treat the same inflammatory conditions. This review specifically assesses the risk of the TNF inhibitors etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab, as well as interleukin-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab. We found multiple cohort studies, randomized controlled trials and case reports that suggest infliximab increases risk of HZ, whereas adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab HZ risk remain controversial. Nevertheless, HZ vaccination should be considered prior to initiation of biological therapy, particularly infliximab. Copyright Â© 2013 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The management of Crohn's disease (CD) is continuously evolving. New issues emerging from more recent studies could influence the decision-making process in clinical practiceAREAS COVERED: The aim of this review article is to highlight critical issues on the management of CD, new evidence from clinical trials, long-term prospective studies and real life experience, beyond the current guidelinesEXPERT OPINION: The role of mucosal healing in clinical practice is uncertain, clinical remission remains the primary end point. The timing for the definition of steroid-resistant CD should be considered between 2 and 4 weeks. Early treatment strategy with immunomodulators is effective for inducing remission but no controlled data are available regarding long-term outcome. Combination therapy (anti-TNFs agents and immunosuppressors) is more effective than single therapy but there is a lack of long-term data and an increased risk of malignancy. The effect of mesalazine, metronidazole and azathioprine in reducing postoperative recurrence is not clinically relevant; biologics are effective, but the duration of treatment is unknown. New drugs are under investigation in order to find exit strategy for patients who no longer respond to biologics. Combination therapy set on anti-TNF-alpha is until now the best option both to achieve fistula healing and avoid recurrence

N2  - Over the last decade, the medical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been revolutionized, with increasing use of both immunomodulatory and biologic medications. Corticosteroids have increasingly been associated with an elevated risk of serious and opportunistic infections, both independently and in combination with immunomodulator and biologic agents. There are limited data on the infectious risk of immunomodulators. It is unclear if anti-tumor necrosis factor agents increase overall infectious risk in patients with IBD, but the available literature has demonstrated an increased risk of opportunistic infections, particularly in terms of tuberculosis and histoplasmosis. Combination therapy likely increases the risk of opportunistic infections in patients with IBD but this has not yet been conclusively proved. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Human anti-chimeric antibodies (HACAs) and subtherapeutic infliximab concentrations are associated with decreased duration of response. We evaluated the clinical utility of measuring HACA and infliximab concentrations.METHODS: The medical records of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who had HACA and infliximab concentrations measured were reviewed to determine whether the result affected clinical management.RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients had HACA and infliximab concentrations measured. The main indications for testing were loss of response to infliximab (49%), partial response after initiation of infliximab (22%), and possible autoimmune/delayed hypersensitivity reaction (10%). HACAs were identified in 35 patients (23%) and therapeutic infliximab concentrations in 51 patients (33%). Of 177 tests assessed, the results impacted treatment decisions in 73%. In HACA-positive patients, change to another anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent was associated with a complete or partial response in 92% of patients, whereas dose escalation had a response of 17%. In patients with subtherapeutic infliximab concentrations, dose escalation was associated with complete or partial clinical response in 86% of patients whereas changing to another anti-TNF agent had a response of 33%. Patients with clinical symptoms and therapeutic infliximab concentrations were continued at the same dose 76% of the time and had no evidence of active inflammation by endoscopic/radiographic assessment 62% of the time.CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of HACA and infliximab concentration impacts management and is clinically useful. Increasing the infliximab dose in patients who have HACAs is ineffective, whereas in patients with subtherapeutic infliximab concentrations, this strategy may be a good alternative to changing to another anti-TNF agent.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Subgroups of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may have an increased risk of developing lymphoma. We sought to identify factors that were associated with lymphoma in patients with IBDMETHODS: Cases and controls were identified through a centralized diagnostic index. We identified 80 adult patients with IBD who developed lymphoma between 1980 and 2009. For each case, 2 controls were matched for subtype of IBD, geographic location, and length of follow-up. Conditional logistical regression was used to assess associations between risk factors and the development of lymphomaRESULTS: Sixty patients were males (75%) versus 77 controls (48%). Median age at index date was 59 years for cases and 42 years for controls. Twenty patients (25%) and 23 controls (14%) were receiving immunosuppressive medications at the index date. Four patients (5%) and 6 controls (4%) were receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents at the index date. In multiple variable analysis, age per decade (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.43), male gender (odds ratio, 4.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-9.02) and immunosuppressive exposure at the index date (odds ratio, 4.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-13.11) were significantly associated with increased odds of developing lymphoma. Disease severity and use of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha agents were not independently associated with developing lymphoma. When testing was performed on patients exposed to immunosuppressive or anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha medications, Epstein-Barr virus was identified 75% of the timeCONCLUSIONS: In this case-control study, increasing age, male gender, and use of immunosuppressive medications were associated with an increased risk of lymphoma in patients with IBD

N2  - The aim of this study was to review the impact of infliximab therapy on children with treatment-resistant Crohn's disease. Treatment resistance was defined as clinically active disease despite &gt; 4 months of immunosuppressive therapy. The outcome variables were time to first remission, duration of remission and the need for surgery. 24 children received 90 infusions of infliximab (16 boys; median 10.3y, range 1.0-14.4y); all had three infusions as an induction course. 17 (70.8%) achieved clinical remission, with 14/17 (82.3%) relapsing within 4 months of the third infusion. 6/7 in the non-responding group and 8/17 of the responders required surgery with an insignificant difference in the median time to surgery (p = 0.49). Four remain dependent on regular infliximab. Infliximab is well-tolerated and highly effective in achieving clinical remission in children with refractory Crohn's disease but may only delay and not avoid the need for surgery. Failure to achieve clinical remission by the 3rd infusion significantly increases the risk of surgery. Â© 2007 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC

N2  - BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Anti-tumor necrosis factors (anti-TNF) including infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol are used to treat Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Paradoxically, while also indicated for the treatment of psoriasis, anti-TNF therapy has been associated with development of psoriasiform lesions in IBD patients and can compel discontinuation of therapy. We aim to investigate IBD patient, clinical characteristics, and frequency for the development of and outcomes associated with anti-TNF induced psoriasiform rashMETHODS: We identify IBD patients on anti-TNFs with an onset of a psoriasiform rash. Patient characteristics, duration of anti-TNF, concomitant immunosuppressants, lesion distribution, and outcomes of rash are describedRESULTS: Of 1004 IBD patients with exposure to anti-TNF therapy, 27 patients (2.7%) developed psoriasiform lesions. Psoriasiform rash cases stratified by biologic use were 1.3% for infliximab, 4.1% for adalimumab, and 6.4% for certolizumab. Average time on treatment (206.3weeks) and time on treatment until onset of psoriasiform lesions (126.9weeks) was significantly higher in the infliximab group. The adalimumab group had the highest need for treatment discontinuation (60%). The majority (59.3%) of patients were able to maintain on anti-TNFs despite rash onset. Among patients that required discontinuation (40.7%), the majority experienced improvement with a subsequent anti-TNF (66.7%)CONCLUSION: 27 cases of anti-TNF associated psoriasiform lesions are reported. Discontinuation of anti-TNF treatment is unnecessary in the majority. Dermatologic improvement was achieved in the majority with a subsequent anti-TNF, suggesting anti-TNF induced psoriasiform rash is not necessarily a class effect.Copyright Published by Elsevier B.V

N2  - The gastrointestinal tract is the largest lymphoid organ in the body containing T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Despite the fact that these cells are constantly confronted with antigen primarily in the form of food and bacteria, immune responses in the gut are tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis. Without this balance of active immunity and tolerance, mucosal inflammation may ensue, and manifest as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pernicious anemia, or celiac sprue. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that inflammatory diseases of the gut are commonly encountered in patients with primary immune deficiencies. The exact pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases in the setting of primary immunodeficiency remains unknown, however, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity appear to play a role in preventing intestinal inflammation. Patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal disease and/or failure to respond to conventional therapy should be evaluated for an underlying primary immune disorder in order to initiate appropriate treatment, such as immunoglobulin or in more severe cases bone marrow transplantation, to prevent long term complications.

Without this balance of active immunity and tolerance, mucosal inflammation may ensue, and manifest as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pernicious anemia, or celiac sprue. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that inflammatory diseases of the gut are commonly encountered in patients with primary immune deficiencies. The exact pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases in the setting of primary immunodeficiency remains unknown, however, both humoral and cell-mediated immunity appear to play a role in preventing intestinal inflammation. Patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal disease and/or failure to respond to conventional therapy should be evaluated for an underlying primary immune disorder in order to initiate appropriate treatment, such as immunoglobulin or in more severe cases bone marrow transplantation, to prevent long term complications.

N2  - Background: Long-term immunosuppressive medications are being used more commonly for a variety of medical conditions, including immune-mediated diseases and organ transplantation. While these medications are often necessary, they are associated with an increased risk of serious infections. Vaccination may be a way to prevent a variety of infections but vaccine responses among patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies have been variable. Purpose: To systematically review the literature describing immune responses among patients on immunosuppressive therapies to vaccinations including influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal, hepatitis A and B, tetanus toxoid, pertussis, varicella, and zoster. Data sources: English language citations in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from 1985 to 2010. Study selection: Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts to identify prospective, controlled studies reporting pre- and post-vaccination titers of recommended vaccines in patients receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapies for full-text review. Data extraction: Three reviewers independently assessed study characteristics including treatment regimens and pre- and post-vaccination titers. Data synthesis: Of the 972 identified titles, fifteen met inclusion criteria. Ten studies assessed the effects of immunosuppressive medications on responses to influenza vaccine, four studies investigated responses following pneumococcal vaccination, and one study assessed both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Five of the studies that evaluated influenza vaccination showed partially diminished responses among individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapies, while one of the pneumococcal vaccine studies showed significantly decreased responses following vaccination. Patients treated with more than one immunosuppressive medication were the least likely to respond to vaccination. Limitations: The heterogeneity of reported outcomes limits generalizeability. Conclusions: Immunosuppressive therapy, particularly combination regimens, may blunt response to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. To ensure the best chance of response, immunizations should be administered prior to initiation of immunosuppressive medications whenever possible. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is uncommon and therapeutically challenging. Its treatment remains poorly characterised due to limited individual centre or practitioner experience. No large series are reported since 2003, yet IBD treatment has changed substantially. Aim To provide an up-to-date review of the published treatment efficacy of currently available therapies for IBD-related PG in the biologic era. Methods Systematic review of cases published post-2003 since the broad availability of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) therapy. Cases which did not have coexistent IBD, were non-English language, of paediatric age or without data on response to therapy were excluded. Results Sixty cases were identified; 55% female, 50% UC, 45% CD, 5% IBD-U. At PG diagnosis, 58% had active and only 15% inactive IBD, with 27% with IBD activity unspecified. Predominant sites were lower limb (48%) and peristomally (25%); 42% had multiple lesions. In 12%, trauma preceded PG. In 42%, new PG appeared whilst on IBD-specific therapy, whilst 28% were on no therapy and in 30%, IBD therapy was unspecified. Of patients on no therapy at PG onset (n = 17), 16 healed; seven with first- and eight with second-line therapy. In total, 34/60 patients received infliximab, four received adalimumab, two had both; with 33 (92%) responding to one or the other. There was no correlation of PG duration or size with healing times. Conclusions Pyoderma gangrenosum appears predominantly during active IBD and is seen equally in CD and UC. New PG may be a manifestation of recrudescent IBD or it follow trauma. Anti-TNFalpha therapy as a first-line agent for PG should be considered, as it appears to be highly effective. Â© 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd

N2  - TNFs are major mediators of inflammation and inflammation-related diseases, hence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of blockers of the cytokine, TNF-alpha, for the treatment of osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and ankylosis. These drugs include the chimeric TNF antibody (infliximab), humanized TNF-alpha antibody (Humira) and soluble TNF receptor-II (Enbrel) and are associated with a total cumulative market value of more than $20 billion a year. As well as being expensive ($15 000-20 000 per person per year), these drugs have to be injected and have enough adverse effects to be given a black label warning by the FDA. In the current report, we describe an alternative, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of turmeric (Curcuma longa) that is very inexpensive, orally bioavailable and highly safe in humans, yet can block TNF-alpha action and production in in vitro models, in animal models and in humans. In addition, we provide evidence for curcumin's activities against all of the diseases for which TNF blockers are currently being used. Mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits the production and the cell signalling pathways activated by this cytokine are also discussed. With health-care costs and safety being major issues today, this golden spice may help provide the solution. Â© 2013 The British Pharmacological Society

N2  - Background: Infliximab reduces mucosal inflammation in some, but not all, patients with Crohn's disease. Aim: To monitor clinical data and changes in mucosal cytokine levels after infliximab treatment to identify differences between responders and non-responders. Methods: Twenty-six patients with fistulating Crohn's disease received three infliximab infusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6. Follow-up was for 1 year and included clinical examination, colonoscopy, ano-rectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Biopsies were taken at weeks 0, 8, 26 and 52. Cell cultures were established and analysed for tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 levels, and related to clinical status and fistula healing. Results: Eleven of 15 patients (73%) with active disease (Crohn's disease activity index &gt; 150) obtained remission (Crohn's disease activity index &lt; 150) at 8 weeks. In in vitro cell cultures, there was reduced tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 production at week 26, with the latter persistent throughout the study period. When the disease deteriorated or relapsed, there was increased interferon-gamma production in in vitro cell cultures. Fistula healing was associated with reduced production of interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10. Conclusions: Infliximab down-regulates mucosal immune activation in Crohn's disease. Monitoring of mucosal cytokine levels after infliximab treatment by whole biopsy cultures may be useful as interleukin-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma production are different in responders and at relapse

N2  - Cytokines and chemokines are essential components for the pathophysiology of sarcoidosis. In the last decade, evidence has accumulated indicating that most of the events that lead to the alveolitis, granuloma formation and tissue injury are regulated by these mediators and their receptors. Recently, information on the possible pathogenetic role of cytokines has been translated into the development of potent cytokine antagonists which have proved to be powerful means of controlling disease activity in some inflammatory diseases. Molecules capable of neutralizing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are currently used in the clinical setting of rheumatoid arthritis and active Crohn's disease. TNF-alpha is one of most important cytokines in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis: not unexpectedly, data suggest the real possibility of using anti-TNF strategies to treat refractory sarcoidosis. These data are preliminary and should promote further clinical trials to confirm both the efficacy and tolerability of anti-TNF agents when used in patients with sarcoidosis and other interstitial lung diseases which are characterized by an up-regulation of TNF-alpha expression in the pulmonary milieu. Blockades of other inflammatory cytokines are also expected to be therapeutic in sarcoidosis and other T-cell mediated diffuse lung diseases. In particular, therapies directed at neutralizing chemokines and other molecules which control trafficking and accumulation of immunocompetent cells are potentially more selective and attractive but require a priori knowledge of precise pathways regulating the inflammation state involving the alveolar and interstitial structures
AB  - Cytokines and chemokines are essential components for the pathophysiology of sarcoidosis. In the last decade, evidence has accumulated indicating that most of the events that lead to the alveolitis, granuloma formation and tissue injury are regulated by these mediators and their receptors. Recently, information on the possible pathogenetic role of cytokines has been translated into the development of potent cytokine antagonists which have proved to be powerful means of controlling disease activity in some inflammatory diseases. Molecules capable of neutralizing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are currently used in the clinical setting of rheumatoid arthritis and active Crohn's disease.

N2  - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), both should be considered as systemic diseases as they are associated with clinical manifestations involving the organs outside the alimentary tract. In a genetically susceptible host with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), complex interaction of bacterial or other local factors in the colon with antigen presenting cells may trigger an immune reaction to a shared antigen in the involved organs. These extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) are observed in up to 20-40% of the patients with IBD. Patients with CD are more susceptible to EIMs than patients with UC. Joints, eyes, skin and biliary tract are the most commonly involved organ systems. Some manifestations such as uveitis, episcleritis may precede the onset bowel disease and some may occur in conjunction with or subsequent to the diagnosis of active bowel disease. Although many EIMs tend to follow the clinical course of IBD and respond to the treatment of underlying bowel disease, some EIMs such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and ankylosing spondylitis tend to follow a course independent of the bowel disease activity. Biological agents, particularly anti-TNFalpha based therapies now assume an important role in the treatment of EIMs. Early recognition and treatment of EIMs are crucial in preventing major morbidity

N2  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab in preventing recurrence after intestinal resection for Crohn's disease in high-risk patientsMETHODS: A multicenter, prospective, observational study was conducted from June 2009 until June 2010. We consecutively included high-risk Crohn's disease patients who had undergone an ileal/ileocolonic resection. High-risk patients were defined as two or more criteria: smokers, penetrating pattern, one or more previous surgical resections or prior extensive resection. Subcutaneous adalimumab was administered 2 wk (+/- 5 d) after surgery at a dose of 40 mg eow, with an initial induction dose of 160/80 mg at weeks 0 and 2. Demographic data, previous and concomitant treatments (antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators or biologic therapies), smoking status at the time of diagnosis and after the index operation and number of previous resections (type and reason for surgery) were all recorded. Biological status was assessed with C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fecal calprotectin. One year (+/- 3 mo) after surgery, an ileocolonoscopy and/or magnetic resonance enterography was performed. Endoscopic recurrence was defined as Rutgeerts score &gt; i2. Morphological recurrence was based on magnetic resonance (MR) score &gt; MR1RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (55.2% males, 48.3% smokers at diagnosis and 13.8% after the index operation), mean age 42.3 years and mean duration of the disease 13.8 years were included in the study. A mean of 1.76 (range: 1-4) resections previous to adalimumab administration and in 37.9% was considered extensive resection. 51.7% had previously received infliximab. Immunomodulators were given concomitantly to 17.2% of patients. Four of the 29 (13.7%) developed clinical recurrence, 6/29 (20.7%) endoscopic recurrence and 7/19 (36.8%) morphological recurrence after 1-year. All patients with clinical recurrence showed endoscopic and morphological recurrence. A high degree of concordance was found between clinical-endoscopic recurrence (kappa = 0.76, P &lt; 0.001) and clinical-morphological recurrence (kappa = 0.63, P = 0.003). Correlation between endoscopic and radiological findings was good (comparing the 5-point Rutgeerts score with the 4-point MR score, a score of i4 was classified as MR3, i3 as MR2, and i2-i1 as MR1) (P &lt; 0.001, r(s) = 0.825). During follow-up, five (17.2%) patients needed adalimumab dose intensification (40 mg/wk); Mean time to intensification after the introduction of adalimumab treatment was 8 mo (range: 5 to 11 mo). In three cases (10.3%), a biological change was needed due to a worsening of the disease after the dose intensification to 40 mg/wk. One patient suffered an adverse eventCONCLUSION: Adalimumab seems to be effective and safe in preventing postoperative recurrence in a selected group of patients who had undergone an intestinal resection for their CD
