
The build server uses the project_posix.json version to build the main project.
This exludes any winx86 config, specifically :
	        "net461": {
            "dependencies": {
                "RavenDB.Client": "3.5.0-rc-35165"
            }
			}

This is needed in Debug because the test project references Raven.Database, which only has a Winx86 dll.
