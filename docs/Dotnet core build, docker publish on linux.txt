install following this web page : https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#debian

this failed and we needed to run as update as recommended for command
	sudo apt-get (update)? curl libunwind8 gettext 


install npm, if not installed : https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions


navigate to project folder

npm install bower (sudo, gloabally)

	sudo npm install -g bower


Run tests

	From test project root
		dotnet restore
		dotnet test

dotnet publish
   
	from the location of the project.json, we want to publish
	relative paths matter, make sure these are correct from the location dotnet.exe is run
	
		dotnet publish -f netcoreapp1.0 -r debian.8-x64 -c Release -o bin/Docker/Release/app
	
Docker build

  Ensure that we run the docker build command in the location of the published docker file. Docker/Release/app
  		sudo docker build --pull=true --rm=true -f Dockerfile -t nice/docsupply-ui:latest .

Docker tag (OPTIONAL : if we need an audit of images by build number)

	sudo docker tag nice/docsupply:latest nice/docsupply:5_11
  
Docker login

	sudo docker login -u niceshared -p YTFmZWUwMjdkZWNjNzQxZDViMzc3NzU3 -e patrick.mcevoy@nice.org.uk

Docker push

	sudo docker push nice/docsupply:latest

Docker remove
	
	sudo docker rmi -f nice/docsupply:latest



	
useful linux command if needed

	delete folder
		sudo rm -rf folderName
		
		Check permissions on app folder
		ls -l 
 
	give permissions and ownership to the user running the dotnet command. (If required)
		sudo chmod 755 /bin -R
		sudo chown shailesh: app
