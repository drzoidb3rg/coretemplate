
Docker 


Create dlls, manual build or VS

Go into project director that holds file 'DockerFile'

Build a docker image

	docker build -t nice/docsupply .
	
	View the available images: docker images
	
Run docker image

	'docker run' runs the raw image, but does not have the dockercompose information

	docker-compose up : this will start ALL images with a docker compose file. DONT do this
	
	docker-compose up -d docsupply   : -d = silent; docsupply is the service name in the docker-compose.yml
	
	
Docker compose notes :

image : [repo]/[imagename]:[tag]
	
public repo on docker hub is nice, ie nice/hdas2:latest

local repo seems to be configured as default "username". so image: username/docsupply:latest	


Gotchas :

	docker build, must be against a DockerFile in the same directory as the dlls. Because of this assumption in the DockerFile		
					# Set the Working Directory
					WORKDIR /app
	
	

Build .net core solution from the location of the docker file

 .\DockerTask.ps1 -Build -Environment Release
 
This requires the .net core framework sdk to be installed as runs the dotnet command line call.
Also, will require docker for windows to be installed on teamcity build agent.
