Setting up ASP NET Core 1.0 and Docker for Windows for VS 2015 Debugging
========================================================================

1) Ensure VS 2015 has Update 3 installed.

2) Install .NET Core 1.0 for visual studio by following the steps here:

   https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows
   
3) Install Docker for Windows as per this article :

   https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/
   
4) Install Docker Tools for Visual Studio 2015 - Preview from here:

   https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0f5b2caa-ea00-41c8-b8a2-058c7da0b3e4
   
   ****Note the following potential pitfalls****
   
   
   1) In docker settings (right click docker icon in taskbar), select the shared drives tab and make sure the drive containing the code (probably c:) is ticked. You'll be prompted
      for an admin account and password. If you don't have one, create a new admin account.
	  
   2) Make sure you have stopped local IIS. Otherwise you'll get this error when you run in Visual Studio:  
   
      SECURITY WARNING: You are building a Docker image from Windows against a non-Windows Docker host. 
	  All files and directories added to build context will have '-rwxr-xr-x' permissions. 
	  It is recommended to double check and reset permissions for sensitive files and directories.

   3) In docker settings (right click docker icon in taskbar), select the network tab and make sure the fixed DNS Server 8.8.8.8 is selected. If this isn't set, the docker/images online
      rep won't be accessible.
	  
   4) When making changes to the docker-compose.yml or docker-compose.debug.yml files, be aware that any tabs in these files will cause errors. To see the actual cause of error, run 
      natively and check the debugger output. =>
	  
	  In powershell, navigate to the directory that contains the docker compose file.
	  
	  docker build -t nice/docsupply .
	  
	  docker-compose up -d nice/docsupply
